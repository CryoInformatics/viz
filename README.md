# VIZ

Viz. Your world through our eyes. The core mission of our team here at CryoInformatics is to offer crisp, effective solutions to real world problems. It's simple, we create the products that we want use. We create the solutions to the problems that we want solved. Viz is the most ambitious project undertaken here at CryoInformatics thus far. Our applicaiton grants users the ability to capture text in a pure form from a photo and translate that text into a multiple different languages. This technology allows a user to complete rapid translations without having to manually input text. Translations come as fast a push of a button. Viz aims to take down the isolating barrier of language around our users and give them the piece of mind to be navigable in far aways lands and comfortable enough to live in their own homes.
